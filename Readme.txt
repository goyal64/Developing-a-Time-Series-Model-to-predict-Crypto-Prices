Steps to reproduce:

1. Retrieve the Bitcoin Hostorical Data from any data source. We retrieved it from Kaggle 
(Link:https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data)
2. Since we will use ARIMA Time Series forecasting, so convert the Non-Stationary Data to Stationary Data.
3. We used historical data retrieved from Kaggle to train the model to predict the prices. 
This data was used to train a time series forecasting model called ARIMA.Model was created using lag order, 
order of differentiation and moving average.
4. Scrape the real-time data. We scraped the streaming data from https://cryptowat.ch/ using web scraping 
techniques with Python.
5. This data will be used to make key value pairs in our MapReduce code, where key will be the timestamp 
of the crypto price at a give point and the values will be the crypto values associated with it.
5. The mapper will take in the streaming data as input and generate key value pair of the timestamp and price 
of bitcoin.
6. The reducer will have the ARIMA model which will first train on the historical data and use the key value 
pair generated by the mapper as test data to predict the future price of bitcoin.
7. This model will have a functionality to monitor real time predicted prices with a flexible tange of dates 
to ease decision-making.
